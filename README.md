## Environment

I am using 

visual code 1.21.0

and NPM version is follows
$npm --version
5.6.0

$ ng --version
Angular CLI: 1.6.8
Node: 9.8.0
OS: linux x64

## Angular App Setup
We are going to use the angular cli to generate a new angular project. 
create a folder for your project called 'file-upload-lambda-s3-incognito'
$ mkdir file-upload-lambda-s3-incognito
$ cd file-upload-lambda-s3-incognito

To generate a new project, run the following angular cli command from your terminal.
$ ng new front-end

This will generate a new project in a folder named ‘front-end’. Next, let’s serve the application so we can view our project in the browser.

Change directories into the project folder.
$ cd front-end

Run the following command in your terminal.
$ ng serve

Your app should now be served at http://localhost:4200/
